# Dungeon Crawler Game

> We are group of young (by age, soul and experience) developers who like programming in their spare time.

> We like to call our programming sesson Javiarenka (which is a word play for 'Java' and 'kawiarenka' - polish word for cafeteria)

> This project is still under construction. Every week we make new commits so feel free to check it out any time soon!

> #backend, #frontend, #project, #portfolio, #game, #practice

## About The Project


This project is basically a cooperative training project - we got together as a team and went on with the idea that we will do something that drives us. The idea for a computer turn based game was sort of perfect for the technologies we wanted to put emphasis on: REST architecture with requests and responses, quite a complicated logic and advanced front-end technologies all will find home in a dungeon crawler type game. 

Another thing that we had in mind was the teamwork - most of us were taught how to program things in Java or JS, but none of the courses that we went through explained how the real work cooperation looks like - Scrum sprints, pull requests, git conflicts and their resolution, backlog grooming, agile methodologies, regular project demos, Jira tickets, burndown charts - these were all the tools of professional programmers, that we earlier had no practice with.

"What's the best way to learn new things, if not to just start doing them" - we thought! 

### Built With
We are using following technologies:
* [Java](https://www.java.com)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* Java supporting IDE (IntelliJ idea is recommended).
* Web browser (Google Chrome is recommended).

### Installation

1. To launch the application, first clone this very repository onto your local PC and find the starting file called "JaviarenkaApplication.java" (src/main/java/com/dungeoncrawler/Javiarenka/JaviarenkaApplication.java).
2. Running this file starts a Tomcat server on your local port number 8080 (which is a default Spring starting port).
3. After launching the file (any Java supporting IDE will do, though IntelliJ idea is recommended), go straight to your favorite web browser and type the following address:
http://localhost:8080/mainMenu
4. This starts the main menu of our project. Enjoy the dungeon crawling!



## Usage
<img src="src\main\resources\static\images\readMe\view.gif" alt="animated game menu">
This is some teaser of how game menu looks like. 

<img src="src\main\resources\static\images\readMe\map.png" alt="dungeon map">
The prototype of the dungeon map. For now it's multitude div's with different background colors, but in the future it would be tiles.

<img src="src\main\resources\static\images\readMe\equipment.png" alt="equipment panel">
This is the equipment screen. You can drag and drop items and yes - you can drag some armor piece and drop it only in the armor slot!

<img src="src\main\resources\static\images\readMe\fightBoard.png" alt="equipment panel">
The prototype of fight board - choose the character and the monster and click the "attack the monster" button. 


## Roadmap

We are still working on it. There may be some (many) bugs that are needed to be fixed but everything needs time. We have backlog full of ideas and we will try to implement them in this project. Ideas fo the nearest future:

* [Concept + Backend] Weapon/Armor Enhancements
* Item Crafting oraz crafting materials
* Drop table and drop event
* World map
* Attributes and uniqe skills for every class
* ...and many more!
